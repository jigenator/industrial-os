# Contributing

Follow the [repository workflow](../CONTRIBUTING.md) as well as this project's checks.

## Toolchain and setup

The maintained content is TOML read by Herdr. The checks use Node.js 22 with its standard library and the design-system package; there is no manifest, dependency or lockfile in this project. Run `npm install` once at the repository root so `@industrial-os/design-system` resolves; see [setup](../CONTRIBUTING.md#setup). The parser check needs an installed Herdr; it was run with Herdr 0.9.3.

## Validation sequence

| Order | Directory | Command | Prerequisites/effects | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `herdr/` | `node --test` | Root install; reads `sidebar.toml`, `spaces.toml`, `theme.toml`, `../pi/herdr-sidebar/docs/token-contract.md` and `../herdr-plugins/spaces/docs/token-contract.md`; no writes | Every color is an exported palette or signal color; every token is in the contract's key list and every key has one row entry; width lock, row gap and theme values; decay ladder, mutually exclusive ACT alternatives and native row/entry limits; Spaces and theme checks below |
| 2 | `herdr/` | `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH="$PWD/sidebar.toml" herdr config check` | Installed Herdr; reads only that file; contacts no server and writes nothing | Herdr's own parser and validation accept the fragment as a config: prints `config: ok`, exit 0 |
| 3 | Herdr | Manual: merge into a config as in the [README](README.md#install), reload, and watch Pi panes running herdr-sidebar | Changes the live Herdr configuration | Rendering, colors, alignment with and without the scrollbar, every state |

Then follow the [repository-wide checks](../CONTRIBUTING.md#repository-wide-checks). Record every check as passed, failed, skipped or not run. Step 2 proves the file parses and validates, not how it looks.

## Making a change

Change the source first: a color in the design system, a token in [the token contract](../pi/herdr-sidebar/docs/token-contract.md). Then change the fragment, keep each color's role comment accurate, update [the design](docs/design.md), and run the sequence.

## Verification records

Record each run with its date, Herdr version and results.

2026-10-08, macOS, Node 22.23.0, Herdr 0.9.3:

- Step 1, `node --test`: **3 of 3 passed**. Mutation check: a non-palette color and an unknown token each made their test fail.
- Step 2, `herdr config check` on the fragment: **`config: ok`, exit 0**. The same check on copies merged by hand into the live-spike configuration and into Herdr's `--default-config` output, in a temporary directory: **`config: ok`, exit 0** for both. A malformed token entry in a copy was rejected with a parse error, showing the rows are validated.
- Step 3, interactive: **not run** for this file. The spike configuration it was derived from was checked live on 2026-10-08, adding only the `$bar_unk` row entry here.

### Pi-only layout follow-up

2026-10-08, macOS, Node 22.23.0, installed Herdr 0.9.3:

- `node --test`: **5/5 passed**, no skipped/cancelled tests. Colors/tokens are checked inside `rows_by_agent.pi`; the regression requires no global `rows`, panel-wide `row_gap = 1`, and a decorative-grey non-bold `bar_idle`.
- `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<temporary copy of sidebar.toml> herdr config check`: **`config: ok`, exit 0**, read-only. No server contact or live configuration change.
- Root links/anchors, guide inventory, exact CLAUDE entrypoints, whitespace and publication checks passed. The architecture diagram renders with existing grok-mermaid 0.2.3, non-null art and no warnings.
- Interactive rendering/reload: **not run**. Merge only `rows_by_agent.pi` and panel-wide spacing; preserve any existing global `rows` and other agent overrides.

### SUB state

2026-10-08, macOS, Node 22.23.0, installed Herdr 0.9.3:

- `node --test`: **6/6 passed**. The new check reads the g1 state codes from the token contract and requires WRK and SUB accent, BLK and QNS critical, DNE primary and IDL/UNK decorative; removing the SUB rule made it fail.
- `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<temporary copy of sidebar.toml> herdr config check`: **`config: ok`, exit 0**. The same on a temporary copy of `herdr --default-config` with the fragment merged by hand: **`config: ok`, exit 0**. Read-only; no server contact or live configuration change.
- Interactive rendering: **not run** for this change.

## Spaces validation

From `herdr/`, run `node --test` for both fragments. The Spaces check reads the
plugin contract's one full-key-list line, tests every custom key exactly once,
every color against design-system exports and global state-icon theme roles.

Then run `node check-config.mjs` from `herdr/`. It invokes installed Herdr 0.9.3's read-only parser, only on temporary copies:

1. `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<spaces-copy> herdr config check`.
2. `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<sidebar-copy> herdr config check`.
3. `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<merged-copy> herdr config check`: merge Spaces color keys
   into sidebar's existing theme.custom, then append ui.sidebar.spaces once.
4. `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<invalid-copy> herdr config check`: a malformed row entry
   must be rejected, not treated as a valid merge.

The [README](README.md#spaces) explains installation order and the global theme
scope. Interactive/live Herdr validation is not authorized and is not run.

### Spaces fragment

2026-10-08, macOS, Node 22.23.0, installed Herdr 0.9.3:

**Passed**

- Root `npm install`: linked the existing design-system package; no tracked
  manifest/lockfile change. This resolved an initial missing-package test run.
- `cd herdr && node --test`: **10/10 passed**, zero skipped/cancelled; six
  existing agents checks and four Spaces palette/key/role/zero-state checks.
- `cd herdr && node check-config.mjs`: invokes exactly
  `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<temporary-copy> herdr config check` on each case:
  - `spaces.toml` alone: **`config: ok`, exit 0**.
  - `sidebar.toml` alone: **`config: ok`, exit 0**.
  - Both merged into one theme.custom table: **`config: ok`, exit 0**.
  - Invalid built-in row token: **rejected, exit 1**, expected; diagnostic
    `unknown sidebar token`. This is a successful negative check, not a failure.
- Root links/anchors, guidance inventory, exact CLAUDE imports, whitespace and
  publication review passed. Existing grok-mermaid 0.2.3 rendered changed root,
  Herdr and Spaces diagrams with non-null art and no warnings.

**Failed (resolved):** initial `node --test` before the root install could not
resolve the design-system package. Final required checks have no failures.

**Skipped:** none of the authorized required checks.

**Not run:** interactive/live Herdr, installed plugin invocation, reload,
rendering with/without scrollbar, native navigation/order and other color
depths/fonts. The approved quiet-space git-only second-row exception and the
five theme keys' wider effects were verified from source, not live rendering.

### Spaces review fixes

2026-10-08, macOS, Node 22.23.0, installed Herdr 0.9.3:

- `cd herdr && node --test`: **10/10 passed**, zero failures/skipped/cancelled;
  Spaces keys now require `sp_` prefixes as well as exact contract membership.
- `cd herdr && node check-config.mjs`: runs only
  `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<temporary-copy> herdr config check`:
  Spaces alone, sidebar alone, and one-table merge each **`config: ok`, exit 0**;
  invalid row copy **rejected, exit 1** expected.
- Root links/anchors, guide inventory, exact CLAUDE entrypoints, whitespace and
  manual publication review: **passed**. No live config or server was contacted.
- Live/interactive Herdr and installation/reload: **not run**. Merge `$sp_` keys
  with the updated reporter; old unprefixed frozen tokens are no longer read.
  The plugin's [corrected protocol evidence](../herdr-plugins/spaces/CONTRIBUTING.md#review-fix-round)
  replaces the initial fake-server compatibility assumption, not parser evidence.

### Spaces isolated rendering

2026-10-08: merged agents and Spaces fragments passed `herdr config check` and
ran in an isolated Herdr 0.9.3 server with the Spaces plugin linked; a client
capture replayed in xterm.js matched the design, including quiet rows with the
Spaces scrollbar shown. The run found quiet rows one cell too wide; the plugin
now sizes them for 31 cells (see the
[plugin record](../herdr-plugins/spaces/CONTRIBUTING.md#isolated-herdr-check)).
Live session merge and reload: **not run**.

### ACT / MDL access decay

2026-10-09, macOS, Node 22.23.0, installed Herdr 0.9.3; source checked offline:

- `cd herdr && node --test`: **13/13 passed**, 0 failures/skipped/cancelled. New checks: `ACT and MDL variants follow the complete access-decay color ladder in their original rows`; `Pi layout and every configured row fit Herdr 0.9.3 limits (16 rows, 16 entries)`; `exactly one ACT alternative resolves at every stage, with unchanged text order and no empty-row gap`. Existing exported-color, contract-key, exactly-one-entry and unaffected-state/Spaces checks still pass.
- `cd herdr && node check-config.mjs` runs only read-only `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<temporary copy> herdr config check`: sidebar, Spaces and one-table merge each **config: ok, exit 0**; malformed control **rejected, exit 1** expected.
- Initial implementation's single 24-entry ACT row was **rejected**: `sidebar rows may contain at most 16 tokens`. Source `src/config/sidebar.rs` also caps layouts at 16 rows. Approved correction: ACT d0+d1 and d2+d3 alternatives, 12 entries each; MDL eight entries in one row; eight configured Pi rows. `src/ui/sidebar/tokens.rs::agent_rows` drops empty alternatives; `src/client/shell/agent_sidebar.rs` applies row_gap only between AgentRow pane blocks. No extra gap is introduced; this is source/model evidence, not live rendering.
- Mutation proof: changed `dir_d2` from structural to the still-exported secondary color; `node --test --test-name-pattern='^ACT and MDL variants' test/sidebar.test.mjs` **failed 1/1, exit 1** as expected. Restored the ladder before the final **13/13** run.
- Root package setup, changed local links/anchors, guidance inventory, exact CLAUDE entrypoints, `git diff --check`, `git diff --cached --check`, new-contributor and exact-file publication/import/color reviews: **passed**. No new dependency or palette value; production reporter still renders no colors.
- Live/interactive Pi/Herdr, config merge/reload, terminal rendering and Mermaid rendering: **not run**; existing diagrams unchanged. Inherited `HERDR_*` variables were unset before every shell/test/parser run; no live socket/configuration or global Pi files touched. No push, PR or Linear mutation.
- Adoption requires the updated complete Pi row override and reporter together; merge rows first so later-stage keys can render. Memory-only age resets on reload/restart. Existing full-report partial-state/backoff, visibility approximation and untested font/color-depth limitations remain.

## Theme validation

From `herdr/`, in order:

1. `node --test`: `test/theme.test.mjs` checks that every `theme.toml` color is an exported palette, signal or Herdr chrome color; that `theme.toml`, `sidebar.toml` and `spaces.toml` together set each of Herdr 0.9.3's 19 `[theme.custom]` keys exactly once (the key list is restated in the test from Herdr's `src/config/theme.rs`); each key's approved value; `panel_bg` the field, because Herdr draws it as the ink on colored controls; and the other fragments' eight theme keys unchanged.
2. `node check-config.mjs`: read-only `HERDR_CONFIG_PATH=<temporary copy> herdr config check` on `theme.toml` alone and on all three fragments merged into one config with a single `[theme.custom]`, besides the Spaces/sidebar cases above. A copy with a misspelled theme key must be rejected (`unknown config key`, exit 1), so the theme copy's `config: ok` shows Herdr knows all 11 keys. The parser does not validate theme color strings; step 1 does.
3. Manual, by an operator: merge as in the [README](README.md#theme), reload, and look at tabs, menus, dialogs, the mode bar, copy-mode search and scrollbars. Changes the live configuration.

A Herdr version change rechecks the 19-key list against that version's `src/config/theme.rs` first.

### Acid & Orange theme

2026-10-09, macOS, Node 22.23.0, installed Herdr 0.9.3. Inherited `HERDR_*` variables were unset before every shell, test and parser run.

**Passed**

- `cd design-system && node --test`: **388/388**, 0 failed/skipped/cancelled, including `package.test.mjs` **4/4** and `foundation/*.test.mjs` **21/21**. The new foundation check: `HERDR_CHROME` is frozen lowercase, `signalOrange` equals `SIGNAL_COLORS.cld`, and `mixOver(signalOrange, 0.3)` is `signalOrange30` `#4d1c00`.
- `cd pi/status-bar && node --experimental-strip-types --test test/footer-colors.test.ts` with the global Pi host: **1/1**. `HERDR_CHROME` is kept out of `SIGNAL_COLORS`, whose every value status-bar maps to a footer alias.
- `cd herdr && node --test`: **18/18**, 0 failed/skipped/cancelled; 13 existing sidebar and Spaces checks and 5 new theme checks.
- `cd herdr && node check-config.mjs`: Spaces, sidebar, theme, sidebar+Spaces merge and all-three merge each **`config: ok`, exit 0**; malformed row copy and misspelled theme key copy each **rejected, exit 1**, expected.
- Mutation checks, each restored: a non-exported `overlay1`, a `yellow` duplicated into `theme.toml`, `panel_bg` set to the surface, `blue` removed, and a changed `sidebar_bg` in `sidebar.toml` each failed the theme tests (2, 3, 2, 3 and 1 of 5 failing); `signalOrange30` set to `#4d1b00` failed the foundation check.
- Root changed links and anchors, guidance inventory, exact CLAUDE entrypoints, `git diff --check`, `git diff --cached --check`, new-contributor and publication/private-path reviews. Existing grok-mermaid 0.2.3 rendered the changed root and Herdr diagrams with non-null art and no warnings.

**Failed:** none. **Skipped:** none.

**Live merge:** the same 11 keys were merged by hand into the operator's config; `herdr config check` printed **`config: ok`, exit 0**, and `herdr server reload-config` returned **`applied`** with no diagnostics.

**Not run:** an agent-observed check of the rendered theme, the mobile layout, and other color depths. What each key colors is from Herdr 0.9.3 source, not observation; contrast ratios are computed from the hex values.
